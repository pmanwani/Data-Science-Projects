# Data-Science-Projects
This repo consists of my completed hobby Data Science Projects. All of them are in the form of an easy to follow Jupyter Notebook. Some of the projects are also included in my website here <a href="https://pmanwani.github.io/">pmanwani.github.io</a> 

# Contents


## HR Analytics
<a href="https://github.com/pmanwani/Data-Science-Projects/blob/master/Company_Diversity/workplace_diversity.ipynb"> Workplace Diversity </a> : HR Analytics project to understand how employees are treated in the workplace. Are they overpaid/overpaid by their sex, department, management level.

<a href="https://github.com/pmanwani/Data-Science-Projects/blob/master/Employee_Retention/employee_retention%20(1).ipynb"> Employee Retention </a> : People Analytics project to understand the factors driving employee attrition. Provide recommendations to reduce employee churn rate.

## Anomaly Detection
<a href="https://github.com/pmanwani/Data-Science-Projects/blob/master/Credit_Card_Fraud/credit%20card%20fraud.ipynb"> Credit Card Fraud </a> : Given credit card transaction data, understand activities that are likely to be an anomaly and could be a fraudulent transaction. Used unsupervised clustering technique to cluster anomalous behavior.

## A/B Test Results

<a href="https://github.com/pmanwani/Data-Science-Projects/blob/master/Engagment%20Test/Engagement_Test.ipynb"> Engagement Test </a> : Analyzing the A/B test results. Applied t-test to compare the groups and see if the test was a success.

## Clustering

<a href="https://github.com/pmanwani/Data-Science-Projects/blob/master/City_Similarity/City-Similarity.ipynb"> City Similarity </a> : Cluster high intent users vs low intent users of an online travel agent company based on logged in session ids. High intent users are likely to book a trip vs low intent who are just browsing.

<a href="https://github.com/pmanwani/Data-Science-Projects/blob/master/Cluster_Grocery/ClusterGrocery.ipynb"> Item Clustering </a> : Cluster Grocery Items to replace manually created categories.

## Supervised Learning

<a href="https://github.com/pmanwani/Data-Science-Projects/blob/master/Conversion%20Rate/conversion_rate.ipynb"> Conversion Rate Prediction </a>: Predict users who are likely to convert for a shopping website i.e to predict how likely that the site tends to turn lookers into buyers. Provide recommendations to improve it.

<a href="https://github.com/pmanwani/Data-Science-Projects/blob/master/Subscription_retention/subscribe_retention.ipynb"> Subscription Retention rate </a> : Model to predict subscription user retention rate at different price points. Understand the factors that affect subscription rate and recommend solutions to improve it.

<a href="https://github.com/pmanwani/Data-Science-Projects/blob/master/Loan%20Grant/.ipynb_checkpoints/Loan%20Grant-checkpoint.ipynb"> Loan Repayment </a> : Model to predict borrowers who have a higher probability of repaying a loan. Thus, improving bank's profitability.
